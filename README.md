The dataset consists of multiple flight records with key features, including airline names, journey durations, number of stopovers, departure and arrival times, and routes. These features serve as independent variables, influencing the final price of the tickets.

​

The dataset is crucial for training the models, allowing them to learn patterns and relationships between flight attributes and ticket prices. Such a model can be instrumental for travel agencies, airlines, and travelers to estimate flight costs and plan bookings efficiently.

### oneAPI Integration

​

For performance optimization, I integrated Intel's oneAPI, an open, unified programming model that enables developers to write code that runs seamlessly on multiple hardware types, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.

​

Using oneAPI’s oneDAL library, I optimized the Random Forest, Ridge Regression and Scikit-Learn to take advantage of hardware accelerators, leading to faster training and prediction times. This enhancement allows the model to provide real-time predictions with high efficiency, even on large datasets.

​

### Models Used

​

Several machine learning models were used and compared for this task, including:

Random Forest (with oneAPI): A robust ensemble method ideal for handling complex datasets.

Linear Regression: For baseline prediction and comparison.

Decision Tree Regressor: To analyze feature importance and interpretability.

Support Vector Machine (SVR): For capturing nonlinear relationships.

Bagging Regressor: As an ensemble model to improve predictive stability.

​

Random Forest, optimized with oneAPI, emerged as the most efficient and accurate model. The combination of hardware acceleration and hyperparameter tuning ensured the model performed well under various conditions.

​

### Results and Discussion

​

The optimized Random Forest model provided reliable predictions with a high R² score, demonstrating its ability to capture the complexity of flight pricing patterns. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to assess the model’s accuracy.

​

The Bagging Regressor was saved for future real-time predictions, providing flexibility for dynamic pricing scenarios. The accurate forecasting achieved in this project shows the potential of machine learning models for travel-related applications, such as personalized fare estimation and dynamic pricing recommendations.

​

### Conclusion

​

This flight price prediction system showcases the benefits of integrating machine learning with oneAPI technology. The optimized Random Forest and scikit-learn models not only achieved high accuracy but also ensured efficient computation across different hardware. Future improvements could involve testing on additional datasets or deploying the system as a real-time pricing API for travel platforms.
